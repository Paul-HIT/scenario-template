 * This one is a server application, it waits for Interest packets from mobile nodes that serve as upload requests,
 * It then sends out Interest towards the mobile node to pull the data it tries to upload.
 * Currently, the name of the uploading mobile node is fixed.
 * Eventually the upload request should include information about the mobile node,
 * and certain verification machanisms should be applied so that this won't be exploited to conduct DDoS attacks.
